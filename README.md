# webscrapingandaws

Designed and built a web scraper program in Python to scrape house data from a real estate website. 
I used BeautifulSoup library from python for scrapping. After collecting the data, 
I stored it in a CSV file and uploaded it to AWS S3 bucket using boto3 library and used it for Data analysis.
